Last Updated: March 27, 2025

Introduction
Welcome to Entrevo (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you use our mobile application (the “App”). We respect your privacy and are committed to safeguarding it through our compliance with this policy.

By using Entrevo, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use our App.

-----------------------------

Who We Are
For the purpose of data protection laws, the data controller is:
Entrevo
Email: entrevoapp@gmail.com

Note: We do not have a registered business address or physical postal address at this time.

-----------------------------

Information We Collect
We only collect limited personal data to provide our services effectively:
1. Email Address – used for account creation and authentication.
2. Name – used as your display name (or “User” if you do not provide a name).
3. Password – stored securely through Firebase Authentication.
4. Viewed Biographies – used to track which entrepreneur profiles you have already seen.
5. Interests (optional) – collected through questions at first launch to help us recommend more relevant entrepreneur biographies.
6. Potential Future Analytics Data – while we do not currently collect analytics information, we may do so in the future to help us understand how users engage with the App.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health data, etc.). We also do not knowingly process data of children under 16. If you believe a child under 16 is using Entrevo, please contact us so we can investigate and remove any personal data if required.

-----------------------------

How We Use Your Information
We use your personal information to:
- Create and manage your account (email, password, and optional name).
- Authenticate your login and maintain your user session.
- Send important account-related messages (e.g., security alerts, updates).
- Track viewed biographies so you can discover new content.
- Optionally collect interest data to personalize content recommendations.
- Potentially analyze usage data in the future to improve the App’s functionality and user experience (if analytics are implemented).

We will only use your personal information for these purposes or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

-----------------------------

Data Retention
We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to:
- Fulfill the purposes for which it was collected (e.g., keeping your account active).
- Comply with legal or compliance obligations.
- After such time, we will securely delete or anonymize your information.

-----------------------------

Data Protection
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information, including:
- Using Firebase Authentication (Google’s infrastructure) for secure account creation.
- Restricting database access via Firestore Security Rules to authorized requests.
- Relying on encryption for passwords and sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.

No method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

-----------------------------

Sharing Your Information
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share it in the following cases:
1. Legal Obligations: If required by law or in response to valid legal processes.
2. Business Transfer: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, under similar privacy protections.

We do not currently share data with advertising networks. We plan to display discrete ads in the future, but they will not require or use your personal information at this time.

-----------------------------

Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location (e.g., EU/EEA under GDPR, California under CCPA), you may have the following rights:
- Access & Update: Request access to or correction of your personal data.
- Deletion: Request the removal of your personal data (e.g., via “Delete Account” in the App).
- Withdrawal of Consent: Where applicable, withdraw consent at any time.
- Object or Restrict: Object to or request restriction of certain processing.
- Portability: Request a machine-readable copy of your data (in certain circumstances).

To exercise any of these rights, please contact entrevoapp@gmail.com. We will respond to legitimate requests within the timeframe required by law.

-----------------------------

International Data Transfers
If you are located outside the country where our servers (or Firebase’s servers) are located, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in a country different from your own. We rely on recognized data transfer mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where appropriate, to ensure your information is protected.

-----------------------------

Children’s Privacy
Entrevo is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you believe a child under 16 is using Entrevo, please contact us so we can investigate and delete any personal data if needed.

-----------------------------

California Residents (CCPA)
If you are a California resident, you have certain additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):
- Right to Know: Request information on the categories and specific pieces of personal data we have collected.
- Right to Delete: Request deletion of personal data we hold about you (with certain exceptions).
- Right to Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights.

We do not sell your personal data. For CCPA requests, please email entrevoapp@gmail.com.

-----------------------------

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will:
1. Post the updated policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.
2. Notify you via email or an in-app message if the changes materially affect your rights.

By continuing to use Entrevo after such changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.
